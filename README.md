# NullObjectGenerator
A library that will create null objects for any generic class.

I really don't like putting nulls in my code. I certainly throw exceptions instead of returning null and never expect
null as a parameter for any of my method calls. I am hoping through the usage of this library, NullPointerExceptions in 
my code will go down even further.
